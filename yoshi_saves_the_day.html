        This book was one I made a long time ago. Mario and Peach get captured by bowser and a group called the Jays captures Daisy and sticks Luigi in the ground. Yoshi finds the toads all frozen and ended up finding Luigi and saved him. They go to Bowser's castle and save Daisy, Mario and Peach. Yoshi becomes giant using a gift from his birthday to defeat bowser and his minions.
